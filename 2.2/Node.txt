Things to do with Node -> Create HTTP servers*****
                       -> Create command line interface(CLI), games, etc...

** HTTP server(hyper-text transfer protocol) ** 

-> protocal/instruction defined for machine to communicate.
-> for web, most common way the Frontend talk to its Backend.(using request and response protocals)

HTTP server -> some code that follows the HTTP protocal and is able to communicate with clients

||  HTTP protocals  ||
-> the client throws some info at the server -> server does something with that info -> server responds with final result...

-> Arguments : something the client sends
-> instead calling a function by its name,the client uses a URL(Uniform Resource Locator.)
-> instead of a function body,the server does something with that request(from client)
-> instead of function returning a value, the server responds with some data...
